# Personal Expense Tracker

## Project Overview
The Personal Expense Tracker is an intuitive web tool that makes effective money management easier. Implementing fundamental functionality like budget setting, spending reporting, and classification will be the main goal of the project's first phase. The development of analytics and reporting tools to assist users in understanding their financial habits will come next.

The application is going to have a responsive and secure design that will make it accessible on desktop and mobile platforms alike. It will be integrated with APIs to enable automatic data entry and real-time changes, streamlining the process and lowering human labor.
